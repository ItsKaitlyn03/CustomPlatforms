  <size=150%><color=#888888>Version 6.0.0</color></size>
        - Basically a complete rewrite of the plugin and updated for 1.13.2
        - Platforms can now be used in the menu
        - Redesigned menu, moved settings section here
           and added a changelog
        - Removed environment override setting because it's implemented in
           the base game itself
        - Added light effects in multiplayer
        - Removed BS Utils as a dependency
        - Simplified custom scripts
        - You can now select platforms for multi-, singleplayer and
           360°-levels separately
        - Revived the API, mappers can specify a platform for their songs again
        - Compatibility with Cinema:
           When a video is played, the default platform
           will be used, if not configured otherwise
        - Platforms installed while the game is running
           are automatically loaded now
        - Also platforms are now loaded lazily, that means the startup time
           decreased drastically
        - Fixed so many bugs I can't even count them";
