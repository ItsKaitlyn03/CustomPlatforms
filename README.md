## Creating New Platforms

There's a comprehensive guide at https://bsmg.wiki/models/platforms-guide.html written by Emma.
For a guide about how to create Custom Scripts use the guide at https://affederaffe.github.io/CustomPlatformsUnityProject/.
The following are the basic steps:

1. Download the Unity project from https://github.com/affederaffe/CustomPlatformsUnityProject, unzip it.

2. Open the Unity project
The project was created and tested in version 2018.1.6f1, other versions may not be supported.

3. Create an empty GameObject and attach a "Custom Platform" component to it
Fill out the fields for your name and the name of the platform.  You can also toggle the visibility of default environment parts if you need to make room for your platform.
Add an icon for your platform by importing an image, settings it to Sprite/UI in import settings, and dragging it into the icon field of your CustomPlatform

4. Create your custom platform as a child of this root object
You can use most of the built in Unity components, custom shaders and materials, custom meshes, animators, etc.
You can only attach your own custom scripts to these objects that are made like in this guide: https://affederaffe.github.io/CustomPlatformsUnityProject/

5. When you are finished, select the root object you attached the "Custom Platform" component to.
In the inspector, click "Export". Navigate to your CustomPlatforms folder, and press save.

6. Share your custom platform with other players by uploading the Platforms' .zip file
