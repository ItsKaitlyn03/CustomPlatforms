        - Security fix:  removed embedded CustomScripts
        - CustomScripts can still be done, create your own mod
           and then add it as a requirement or suggestion

<size=150%><color=#888888>Version 6.1.0</color></size>
        - Many new features for platform makers
        - Further reduced loading time
        - Performance improvements
        - Fixed a bug where the credits environment wouldn't be hidden

<size=150%><color=#888888>Version 6.0.0</color></size>
        - Basicly a complete rewrite of the plugin and updated for 1.13.2
        - Platforms can now be used in the menu
         - Redesigned menu, moved settings section here and added a changelog
        - Removed environment override setting because it's implemented in 
           the base game itself
        - Added light effects in multiplayer
        - Removed BS Utils as a dependency
        - Simplified custom scripts
        - You can now select platforms for multi-, singleplayer and 
           360°-levels seperately
        - Revived the API, mappers can specify a platform for their songs again
         - Compatibility with Cinema: When a video is played, the default platform 
           will be used, if not configured otherwise
        - Platforms installed while the game is running 
           are automaticly loaded now
        - Also platforms are now loaded lazily, that means the startup time
           decreased drasticly
        - Fixed so many bugs I can't even count them";
